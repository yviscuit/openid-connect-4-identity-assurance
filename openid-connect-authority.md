.# Abstract

This document defines an extension of OpenID Connect for providing Relying Parties with verified Claims about the relationships between entities, in a secure way, using OIDC and OAuth 2.0 protocols.  This extension is intended to be used to communicate a relationship between a natural person and another entity in a way that can be relied upon.
That second related entity could be a legal entity or another natural person.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction {#Introduction}

Building upon the work done in the OIDF [@!OpenID] eKYC & IDA Working group on verified claims for natural persons there is a need to be able to deliver verified claims about the authority a natural person has to act on behalf of another entity such as a legal entity.  As described in Section 1 of the OpenID Connect specification [@!OpenID], OpenID Connect "enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User" This extension will therefore focus on communicating details of a natural person's authority over another entity. 

Note: Work to define how direct claims of a legal entity are transferred could use elements of eKYC & IDA specifications such as the structure of the verified_claims element and there are specific claims added as part of this document to enable legal entities to be uniquely defined.




## Terminology

This section defines some terms relevant to the topic covered in this document

> Legal entity:
> - [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/legal-entity)... "a company or organization that has legal rights and responsibilities"
> - [Business dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/legal-entity.html)... "
An association, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, trust, or individual that has legal standing in the eyes of law. A legal entity has legal capacity to enter into agreements or contracts, assume obligations, incur and pay debts, sue and be sued in its own right, and to be held responsible for its actions.

> Natural person:
> - [Business dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/natural-person.html)
"A human being, as opposed to a juridical person created by law."

> Authority:
> - [Business dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/authority.html)
> 1. Institutionalized and legal power inherent in a particular job, function, or position that is meant to enable its holder to successfully carry out his or her responsibilities.
> 2. Power that is delegated formally. It includes a right to command a situation, commit resources, give orders and expect them to be obeyed, it is always accompanied by an equal responsibility for one's actions or a failure to act.
> - [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/authority)
> "the official power to make decisions for other people"

# Scope and Requirements

Use cases relating to Legal entities and initiated by an End-User relate to "authority to act" where the End-User themselves is authorizing the presentation of the claims.  In one example a director of a company has the authority to act on its behalf.  When communicating data in this example there will be data about the delegated authority including:

* Which entity the authority applies to
* Claims about the entity that has the authority to act
* Claims that define the scope of the authority
* Claims that may apply limitations of the authority
* Claims about how the authority is granted

## In Scope Use Cases

There are a number of use cases that were considered when writing this document as detailed below.  However  this document is to deliver a specification for "authority to act" related use cases.

### Get authority of natural person over legal entity
"As a relying party I require specific attributes about the relationship a natural person has to a legal entity and how the details of the relationship were established"

> - Key attributes relating to the natural person e.g.
>   - name
>   - address
>   - date of birth
>   - personal identification number (e.g. social security number)
> - Key attributes relating to the legal entity itself e.g.
>   - company number
>   - registered name
>   - registered address
>   - country of registration
> - The nature of the relationship between natural person and legal entity
>   - The scope of the authority e.g.
>     - shareholder
>     - director
>     - staff member (e.g. regulatory matters, public relations)
>   - Any limitations of the authority e.g.
>     - time (can only use authority on weekdays)
>     - audience (tax authority or accountant)
>     - budget (up to £5000)
>     - functional domain (finance, human resources)
>     - other dependencies (2nd approver)
>   - How the authority was granted
>     - delegated by director as part of job
>     - documented at company register
>     - appointed by legal process (e.g. insolvency court)

This use case is the focus of this document


### Get authority of natural person over another natural person
"As a relying party I require specific attributes about the relationship a natural person has to a another natural person and how the details of the relationship were established"
> - Key attributes relating to the natural person who has the authority e.g.
>   - name
>   - address
>   - date of Birth
>   - personal identification number (e.g. social security number)
> - Key attributes relating to the natural person to which the authority applies e.g.
>   - Name
>   - Address
>   - Date of Birth
>   - personal identification number (e.g. social security number)
> - The nature of the relationship between the natural persons
>   - The scope of the authority e.g.
>     - financial
>     - medical
>     - familial
>     - legal
>   - Any limitations of the authority e.g.
>     - time (e.g. can only use authority on weekdays)
>     - audience (e.g. tax authority or accountant)
>     - budget (e.g. up to £5000)
>     - other dependencies (e.g. 2nd approver)
>   - How the authority was granted
>     - delegated by the natural person to whom the authority applies to (e.g. giving authority to a spouse to access an account)
>     - appointed by a legal process (e.g. power of attorney)
>     - asserted by a person (e.g. parent of a minor)

This use case is the secondary focus of this document


## Out of Scope Use Cases

### Get details of legal entity
"As a relying party I require specific attributes about a legal entity"

While this use case is important it is not within the scope of this specification as it is not a fit for OpenID Connect due to the fact that OpenID Connect is focussed on claims about the End-User.

### Details of the relationship of legal entity to another legal entity
"As a relying party I require specific attributes about the relationship between two legal entities and how that relationship was established"

While this use case is important it is not within the scope of this specification as it is not a fit for OpenID Connect due to the fact that OpenID Connect is focussed on claims about the End-User.

# Claims

In order to fulfill the requirements of some jurisdictions on identity assurance, this specification defines the following Claims for conveying data in addition to the Claims defined in the OpenID Connect specification [@!OpenID]:

## Claims about a legal entity

| Claim | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
|`organization_name`|String|legal entity name|
|`registration_number`|String|Registration number|
|`lei`|String|Legal Entity Identifier|
|`organization_type`|String|Legal entity type (limited, charity, not-for-profit)|
|`registered_address`| JSON object | Registered address. The value of this member is a JSON structure containing Claims as defined in Section 5.1.1 of the OpenID Connect specification [@!OpenID]|
|`registered_jurisdiction`|String|String representing the Jurisdiction that the legal entity is registered in|
|`organization_status`|String|status (active, dormant, closed)|
|`incorporation_date`|String| A reference date in [@!ISO8601-2004] YYYY-MM-DD format that is used to represent the date of incorporation of the legal entity|
|`last_accounts_date`|String|A reference date in [@!ISO8601-2004] YYYY-MM-DD format that is used to represent the date of the most recent accounts by the legal entity|
|`trading_as`|array|Trading name(s)|

## authority Element {#authority}

This specification defines a generic mechanism to allow communication of authority claims via JSON-based assertions. The basic idea is to use a container element, called `authority` to provide the RP with a set of claims that can be used to express the authority that may exist of one entity over another.
This set of `authority` claims are presented as claims about the End-User and it allows for the use of the sub-elements `applies_to`, `permission`, and `granted_by`.

The following example uses the verified claims structure from the draft eKYC & Identity assurance specification:

<{{examples/response/authority_claims_simple.json}}

This would assert to the RP that the OP has verified the claims provided (`given_name`, `family_name`, `birthdate`, and the `authority` sub-element) according to an example trust framework `authority_claims_example_framework`.

The normative definition is given of the following.

`authority`: Object or array containing one or more authority objects.

A single `authority` object consists of the following sub-elements:

* `applies_to`: REQUIRED. Object that contains data about the entity that the authority applies to.
* `permission`: REQUIRED. Object that is the container used for defining the actions that the End-User is permitted to take in relation to the entity defined in the `applies_to` sub element of `authority`.
* `granted_by`: OPTIONAL. Object that is the container for definition of how the authority was granted to the End-User.

Note: Implementations MUST ignore any sub-element not defined in this specification or extensions of this specification.

Note: If not stated otherwise, the sub-elements in `authority` are as defined above. Extensions of this specification, including trust framework definitions, can define further constraints on the data structure by changing `granted_by` from "OPTIONAL" to "REQUIRED".

A machine-readable syntax definition of `authority` is given as a JSON schema in [@!authority.json]. It can be used to automatically validate JSON documents containing an `authority` element.

## `applies_to` element

The `applies_to` sub-element is intended to convey claims that allow unique identification of the entity that the authority applies to.  The applies to sub-element may contain a number of different claims and those will depend on the particular use case and will, in particular, depend on whether the `applies_to` sub-element is identifying a legal entity or a natural person.

In the case that the authority applies to a Legal entity the `applies_to` element MAY contain one or more of the following Claims (and others as required) providing it allows for sufficient confidence that the legal entity can be uniquely identified from that set of claims:

* `organization_name`
* `registration_number`
* `lei`
* `type`
* `registered_address`
* `registered_jurisdiction`
* `date_of_incorporation`

In the case that the authority applies to a natural person the `applies_to` element MAY contain one or more of the following Claims as defined in Section 5.1 of the OpenID Connect specification [@!OpenID] (and others as required) providing it allows for sufficient confidence that the natural person can be uniquely identified from that set of claims:

* `name`
* `given_name`
* `middle_name`
* `family_name`
* `birthdate`
* `address`

## `permission` element

The `permission` sub-element is intended to convey the range of actions that the End-User is allowed to take when acting for the entity identified in the `applies_to` sub-element.

The `permission` sub-element consists of an array of objects that contain the following objects and MAY contain further objects that describe any additional extensions or restrictions of the rights has over the target entity:

* `role`: REQUIRED. Object that reflects the role held by the End-User in relation to the target entity
* `validity`: OPTIONAL. Object that contains an array that MUST have either a `start` or `end` and can optionally have both.  Both the `start` and `end` objects are a reference date in [@!ISO8601-2004] YYYY-MM-DD format that is used to represent and are used to define the date limits of the authority being conveyed.
* `budget`: OPTIONAL. Object that contains an array that MUST have both `value` and `currency` elements. This object is intended to describe the maximum extent of the End-User's financial authority. The `value` object will be a string that includes a decimal point and accurate to two decimal places. The `currency` object will contain the alphabetic format defined in [@!ISO4217-2015] (Currency codes) and defines which financial currency the value is in.
* `audience`: Limitation of the scope of entity or entities that the End-User may communicate with when acting on behalf of the entity defined in the `applies_to` element
* `function`: Limitation of the scope of action that the End-User may take by functional domain

## `granted_by` element

The `granted_by` sub-element is intended to convey the manner in which the permission came to be associated with the End-User. 
The `granted_by` sub-element MAY contain the claims described below and MAY contain further objects that describe any additional data about how the authority was vested in the End-User:

* `method`: REQUIRED. The `method` claim is a definition of how the authority came to lie with the End-User.  In an implementation tere SHOULD be a defined set of valid values, these values MAY include:
>  * "delegated": Where a holder of authority passes some or all of their authority on to the End-User. e.g. director of company delegates some authority to a member of staff
> * "appointed": Where a legal authority such as a court of law defined that the authority will be vested in the End-User.  e.g. administrators are appointed by the court to manage a company in difficulties or social services are appointed as guardians of a vulnerable person.
> * "self asserted": Where the End-User themselves has stated that the authority belongs to them.  e.g. the claim of parenthood over a child
* `granting_body`: OPTIONAL.  The `granting_body` claim is used to identify the body that vested the authority in the End-User.  e.g. The High Court of London or another member of staff at the End-User's employer that already has the authority and has the authority to delegate that authority.
* `reason`: OPTIONAL. The `reason` claim is a description of why the authority was granted to the End-User.

** Question - should there be a chain of authority built or should it just be a summary of the overall grant process? perhaps with clearer definition in the trust framework ** 

# Requesting authority claims

Making a request for authority claims and related verification data can be explicitly requested on the level of individual data elements by utilizing the `claims` parameter as defined in Section 5.5 of the OpenID Connect specification [@!OpenID].

It is also possible to use the `scope` parameter to request one or more specific predefined claim sets as defined in Section 5.4 of the OpenID Connect specification [@!OpenID].

## Error Handling

The OP has the discretion to decide whether the requested verification data is to be provided to the RP. An OP MUST NOT return an error in case it cannot return a requested verification data, even if it was marked as essential, regardless of the data being unavailable or the End-User not authorizing its release.

# OP Metadata {#opmetadata}

The OP advertises its capabilities with respect to authority Claims in its openid-configuration (see [@!OpenID-Discovery]) using the following new elements:

`authority_claims_supported`: Boolean value indicating support for `authority`, i.e. the OpenID Connect authority claims extension.

`authority_permissions_supported`: JSON array containing all values for the `role` claim utilized by the OP for authority permissions.

`authority_granted_methods_supported`: JSON array containing all values for the `method` claim utilized by the OP for commmunicating how authority was confered.

`authority_claims_supported`: JSON array containing all claims supported within `authority`.

This is an example openid-configuration snippet:

```json
{
...
   "authority_claims_supported":true,
   "authority_permissions_supported":[
     "Director",
     "Finance Officer",
     "Member of Staff"
   ],
   "authority_granted_methods_supported":[
      "delegated",
      "appointed",
      "self-asserted"
   ],
   "documents_supported":[
       "idcard",
       "passport",
       "driving_permit"
   ],
   "documents_verification_methods_supported":[
       "pipp",
       "sripp",
       "eid"
   ],
   "authority_claims_supported":[
         { "applies_to": [
                "company_name",
                "company_number",
                "jurisdiction"
            ]
         },
        { "permission": [
                "role",
                { "validity":[
                    "start",
                    "end"
                    ]
                }
            ],
        }
        { "granted_by": [
                "method",
                "granting_body",
                "reason"
                ]
        }
   ],
...
}
```

The OP MUST support the `claims` parameter and needs to publish this in its openid-configuration using the `claims_parameter_supported` element.

# Privacy Consideration {#Privacy}

The use of scopes is a potential shortcut to request a pre-defined set of claims, however, the use of scopes might result in more data being returned to the RP than is strictly necessary and not achieving the goal of data minimisation. The RP SHOULD only request End-User claims and metadata it requires.

# Security Considerations {#Security}

This specification focuses on mechanisms to carry End-User claims and accompanying metadata in JSON objects and JSON web tokens, typically as part of an OpenID Connect protocol exchange. Since such an exchange is supposed to take place in security sensitive use cases, implementers MUST combine this specification with an appropriate security profile for OpenID Connect. 

This specification does not define or require a particular security profile since there are several security 
profiles and new security profiles under development. Implementers shall be given flexibility to select the security profile that best suits their needs. Implementers might consider [@?FAPI-1-RW] or [@?FAPI-2-BL]. 

Implementers are recommended to select a security profile that has a certification program 
or other resources that allow both OpenID Providers and Relying Parties to ensure they have complied with the profile’s security and 
interoperability requirements, such as the OpenID Foundation Certification Program, https://openid.net/certification/.

The integrity and authenticity of the issued assertions MUST be ensured in order to prevent identity spoofing. 
The Claims source MUST therefore cryptographically sign all assertions.

The confidentiality of all End-User data exchanged between the protocol parties MUST be ensured using suitable 
methods at transport or application layer.

# Predefined Values {#predefined_values}

This specification focuses on the technical mechanisms to convey authority claims and thus does not define any identifiers for trust frameworks, id documents, or verification methods. This is left to adopters of the technical specification, e.g. implementers, identity schemes, or jurisdictions.

Each party defining such identifiers MUST ensure the collision resistance of those identifiers. This is achieved by including a domain name under the control of this party into the identifier name, e.g. `https://mycompany.com/identifiers/cool_verification_method`.

The eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group maintains a wiki page [@!predefined_values_page] that can be utilized to share predefined values with other parties.
